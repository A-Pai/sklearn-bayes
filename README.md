# Bayesian Regression Models

## Bayesian Regression with evidence approximation

This model is similar to ridge regression but does not require cross-validation. Works well in case of multicollinearity.
You can find python implementation [here](https://github.com/AmazaspShumik/Bayesian-Regression-Methods/blob/master/bayesian_regression.py) Matlab implementation [here](https://github.com/AmazaspShumik/Bayesian-Regression-Methods/blob/master/BayesianRegression.m). There is also small tutorial that compares OLS and Bayesian Regression [here](https://github.com/AmazaspShumik/Bayesian-Regression-Methods/blob/master/bayesian_regression_demo.ipynb).
